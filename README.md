A sample Unity app demonstrating multiplayer chat system

<h1>How to use</h1>

0. Press the green 'Code' button on the top right corner, and click on 'Download zip'. Extract all.

1. Open 'PlayToday Chat App Challenge' inside the Build folder.

2. Press Play and click on Host to start a local server.
(If you press Join while there is no server, nothing will happen-- a pop-up to notice the user would be something I would have added if I had more time.)

3. Open another client and press Join. You are now connected to the local server that you created in Step 2.

4. Select a message on any client and press Enter to send. You should be able to see it from the other client(s).
