To the Senior dev role here we go!!

Downloading Unity right now on my surface Pro 9... please work please

Since the task seems fairly easy I want to go extra mile to impress them, but what should I do?
1. Make the solution in every multiplayer system; Mirror, Fishnet, Netcode, etc I kinda always wanted to try Netcode so this might be a great opportunity
2. Just make one but make it super cool and juicy with customized buttons and animations and vfx and polish it
3. Embed AI? make GPT decide the content of the strings... ayo that'd be cool but it'll get a bit heavy since i'll have to check for connection and all that

HMMMMMMMMMMMM

i think first of all i start as small and simple as possible using what im familiar with, mirror, then try out 1 and then pick my favourite one and then try out 2 or 3
