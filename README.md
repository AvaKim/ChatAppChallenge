To the Senior dev role here we go!!

Downloading Unity right now on my surface Pro 9... please work please

Since the task seems fairly easy I want to go extra mile to impress them, but what should I do?
1. Make the solution in every multiplayer system; Mirror, Fishnet, Netcode, etc I kinda always wanted to try Netcode so this might be a great opportunity
2. Just make one but make it super cool and juicy with customized buttons and animations and vfx and polish it
3. Embed AI? make GPT decide the content of the strings... ayo that'd be cool but it'll get a bit heavy since i'll have to check for connection and all that

HMMMMMMMMMMMM

i think first of all i start as small and simple as possible using what im familiar with, mirror, then try out 1 and then pick my favourite one and then try out 2 or 3


unity still downloading, library wifi seems really slow ... or it might be my os :(  welp

hmm i can start by sketching the rough design i guess

so it's going to have a list of string, and these will be displayed in UI buttons
Buttons should be contained within the Horizontal layout group component, right above the chat bar? i guess. and you may swipe it left or right to see more options
The chat bar will display what is selected and there is a "Send" button inside the chat bar

But of course the simplest prototype can just have a dropdown (the ugly built-in UI, sorry unity) for the list of string
ok unity is installed
